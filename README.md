# Selma you know for mapping

Just add Selma to your build, define a Mapper interface:

```java
@Mapper
public interface SelmaMapper {

    OutBean asOutBean(InBean in);

}
```

Then ? Well just use the generated Mapper:

```java

    SelmaMapper mapper = Selma.mapper(SelmaMapper.class).build();

    OutBean res = mapper.asOutBean(in);

```

And voil√† !
